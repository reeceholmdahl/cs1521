Made CMakeLists.txt and set up out of source build directory (not included in git via gitignore). Made a driver file to test proper compilation.

Reviewed and modified specs in the implementation header file as per assignment requirements. Built 'itemInfo' data structure as an alternative design choice to parallel arrays. Attempted a rudimentary implementation of the 'add' method.

Tested add method (albeit basically) and expected behavior occurred.

Thinking about exceptions or special case return.

Implemented invalid argument exception to throw when receipt is not found within the bag instead of returning a null object or some other special case. Will validate signatures to make sure they still apply and work on other methods now.

Only two methods left are getFrequencyOf and contains. Made basic implementation of contains, and appears to be working so far, more testing required.

Implemented, tested, and verified functionality of two remaining methos: getFrequencyOf and contains. Core requirements should be completed, will review project2 page then work on modular testing routine.
